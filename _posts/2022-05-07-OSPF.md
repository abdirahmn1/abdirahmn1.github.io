OSPF is an open standard and stands for Open shortest path first, it is a linkstate routing protocol that dynamically chooses the routes based on the cost of the links that the packet will traverse compared to distance vector routing protocols like RIP (Routing information protocol) that choose a path depending on the number of hops a packet has to take in order to reach the destination Network and is probably one of the most desployed IGP (interior gateway protocol) in existence today, you see it in environments such as data centres, service providers and enterprise. This is because of its robustness and how much you can do with the protocol. In this post, we'll take a look at how OSPF operates and an overview of its basic concepts.

## OSPF Concepts

### OSPF Network Types

#### Broadcast


### OSPF path cost

OSPF path costs are determined by the speed of the egress interfaces
on the router in the OSPF area. a Gigabit link (1000mbps) for example is a cost of 1, a
hundred megabit link (100mbps) is a cost of 10. Routers have become much faster and 1000 mbps as the reference bandwidth isn't enough, this reference bandwidth can be changed to fit your environment  by executing

> Remember to change the reference bandwidth on all routers running ospf.
{: .prompt-warning}

```console
configure terminal
router ospf <PROCESS NUMBER>
auto-cost reference-bandwidth <BANDWIDTH IN mbps>
```

### OSPF Router ID (RID)

an OSPF RID is used to distinguish between routers in an OSPF area. When an OSPF process is brought up, the router checks to see if an RID has been configured, if none are configured, it falls back to the 2nd option which is the loopback address, if many loopback addresses are configured, it uses the loopback address with the highest IP address. for example, loopback0 with 5.5.5.5/24 will be chosen over loopback1 with 2.2.2.2/24. if both of these aren't configured, OSPF will use the highest IP address on any active interface as RID of that OSPF process unless the OSPF process is terminated or killed. Then the router will go through all these options looking to assign a RID. also assigning a RID while an OSPF process is running will result in that new RID to take effect immediately compared to assigning a higher IP to some active interfaces or creating new loopbacks which will not take effect unless the OSPF process is terminated or the router is restarted.

### OSPF States

#### Down

This is the initial OSPF neighbor state. It means that no information (hellos) have been received from a neighbor, but hello packets can be sent.

#### Attempt

This state is only valid for manually configured neighbors in a Non-BroadcastMultiaccess (NBMA) environment, the router sends unicast hello packets every poll interval to the neighbor from which hellos have not been received within the dead interval.

#### INIT

At this stage, the router has recieved hello messages from its neighbors
