Hi there 👋, i'm back.

It's been a while and i hope you are doing well.

I took some time off due to career changes, moving from network engineering to software development, it's been quite a journey.
Am glad i did network engineering before transitioning to development. What's particularly satisfying for me is how seamlessly my infrastructure and IT experience from networking transitioned into the world of development. Join me as i continue exploring and stay tuned for more.

Take good care 🤝.
